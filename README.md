# YouTube_Data_API_Analysis_Using_Python

## Problem Statement: The advertising firm seeks out influential YouTube channels to feature their ad.

### To find the solution, I utilized the YouTube Data API within Python to Scrape YouTube data from YouTube Channels using their channel ID. I have extracted Channel_id, Channel_name, Channel_Started, Subscribers, TotalViews, TotalUploadedVideos, Custom_url, and Country. The extracted data was loaded into a pandas DataFrame to facilitate exploration and manipulation. Subsequently, I employed the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to generate data visualizations, which revealed valuable insights:

# -- Apna College Channel has 30.4% of the total subscribers within the dataset.

# -- The most popular channel in the current dataset is Apna College with 5120000 Subscribes and The least popular channel in the dataset is MistrAI with 1330 Subscribes.

![Percentage of Views for Each Channel](https://github.com/adityas1335/YouTube_Data_API_Analysis/assets/108605877/ec956399-1152-437f-a7d7-3f4e2ba1ef91)

# -- Only Apna College has 42.1% of the total viewership.

# -- The most-watched channel is Apna College, with 793,733,200 views, while the least-watched channel is MistrAI, with only 48,218 views.

# -- But there is one channel "Singh in USA" which has almost half the subscribers than Channel "Learn More". but in viewership is double.

# -- The data shows the highest channel creation activity in 2020 and 2023

# -- And the highest number of channels created in IN (India).

# -- As measured by subscriber count and viewership, Channels with larger subscriber bases tend to attract more views, likely due to a built-in audience who actively engages with their content. On the other hand, channels with fewer subscribers may struggle to gain visibility and traction, resulting in lower view counts.

# -- According to Avobe analysis, I can recommend three top channels that can be best for an advertisement are follow as:
# 1. Apna College
# 2. Nitish Rajput
# 3. Singh in USA
